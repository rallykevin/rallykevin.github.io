    - title : Secure and Efficient CKKS Computation on Cloud (funded by CryptoLab)
      year: 2023-Now
      description: This project's goal is to design a secure and efficient technique to compute CKKS on cloud environment. This is a cornerstone research to develop a SaaS on cloud.
    - title : Accurate Privacy-Preserving RNN (funded by National Intelligence Service)
      year: 2023-Now
      description: This project's goal is to design a privacy-preserving RNN. Similar to the previous year's work, we aim to find a new approach in efficiently implementing Privacy Preserving Techniques for accurate RNN computing, which would lead to huge models as transformers.
    - title : Implementing Zero-error PPAI (funded by National Intelligence Service)
      year: 2022
      description: This project was funded by NIS to design a Zero-error Privacy Preserving AI inference framework. The framework is implemented using multiple privacy-preserving techniques.
    - title : FPGA Accelerator for CKKS (funded by CryptoLab)
      year: 2022
      description: This project was funded by CryptoLab to design FPGA accelerator for the well-known specific FHE scheme, CKKS. This is a cornerstone research to develop HW Intellectual Property for CryptoLab.
    - title : FPGA Accelerator for FHE (funded by National Intelligence Service)
      year: 2021
      description: This project was funded by NIS to design HW accelerator to accelerate FHE computation.
    - title : Post-Quantum-Cryptography Hardware Accelerator (w. Samsung LSI)
      year: 2020-Now
      description: This project's goal is to design PQC modules that are to be implemented in devices (e.g., smartphoes, IPTV) as HW components. As co-team manager, I participated in most of the process from algorithm analysis to HW implementation. (This project is a Industry-University Cooperation Research between Samsung and SORLab)
